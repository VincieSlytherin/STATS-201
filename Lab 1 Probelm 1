Instructions:
Simulate the Buffon’s Needle experiments. 
Please calculate, simulate and store the estimated number of π using 100, 1000, 10000, 100000 trials,
and plot the estimated numbers versus trial numbers to visualize the convergence 
(better use logarithmic coordinate for the number of trials).
