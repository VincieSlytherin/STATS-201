Instructions:
Consider n people who are attending a class and n is smaller than 200. 
We assume that every person has an equal probability of being born on any day during the year, 
independently of everyone else, and ignore the additional complication presented by leap years 
(i.e., nobody is born on February 29, we have 365 days for one year). 
What is P(n), the probability that for all n people each person has a distinct birthday? 
Please calculate and simulate the P(n) and plot the P(n) against n to visualize the trend.

for n in range(1,200):
    b=0
    for i in range(10000):         
        a=np.random.randint(1,366,n)
        if len(np.unique(a))==n:
            b=b+1
    p.append(b/10000)
plt.plot(p);
