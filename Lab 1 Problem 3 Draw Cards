# Instructions
Draw the top 7 cards from a well-shuffled standard 52-card deck 
(note in a standard deck of 52 cards, there is a total of 4 Kings 
see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck).
Find the probability that the 7 cards include exactly 3 Kings. 
Please solve it mathematically and use computer simulation to prove your solution.

# mathematically calculation
import numpy as np
from math import factorial
def f(a,b):
    return factorial(b)/factorial(b-a)/factorial(a)
p=f(3,4)*f(4,48)/f(7,52)
p

# comptuer simulation
import numpy as np
n_trials=100000
n=0
for a in range(n_trials):
    cards = np.arange(1,53)%13    
    np.random.shuffle(cards)
    b=cards[:7]
    if list(b).count(0)==3:
        n=n+1
print(n/n_trials)
