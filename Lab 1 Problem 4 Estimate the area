# Instruction
Please use simulation to estimate the area under the graph of y = 1/(x + 1) in the unit square (x in [0,1], y in [0,1]) 
in the same way as in Fig 2.3 of the Grinstead book. 
Calculate the true value of this area and use your simulation results to estimate the value of log2. 
How accurate is your estimation?
the area under the graph =ln2=0.6931471805599453

# mathematically calculation
import numpy as np
x=np.linspace(0,1,100000)
y=1/(x+1)
np.sum(y/100000)


# computer simulation
import numpy as np
x=np.random.rand(100000)
y=np.random.rand(100000)
a=np.mean(y<1/(x+1))
b=math.log(2)
print('error:'+ str((b-a)/b))
