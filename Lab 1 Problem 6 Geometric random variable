# Instruction
If 𝑋 is a geometric random variable with 𝑝 = 0.25, what is the probability that 𝑋 ≥ 4? 
Verify your result by performing a computer simulation.


# mathematically calculation
p=0.25
F4=1-(1-p)**3
P=1-F4
P


# computer simulation
z = np.random.geometric(p=0.25, size=10000000)
(z >= 4).sum() /10000000
